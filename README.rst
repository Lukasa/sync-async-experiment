Untilted Sync/Async HTTP Client Experiment
==========================================

This repository is essentially a scratch space for me to gather my thoughts
about writing a single HTTP client library that works with both synchronous and
asynchronous backends in Python.

This library will never be production ready in its current form: it mostly
provides a place for me to kick around ideas.
